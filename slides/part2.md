# Setting Expectations

- We have only 2 hours
- This workshop aims to bootstrap you into the process of building a mobile app
- It is not a comprehensive guide to creating mobile apps
- We will be focusing on the aspects unique to react-native and some other fun stuff :)
- I've provided a list of recommended reading materials in the setup document, which should get you more up to speed on react native after this workshop

---
# Format of Workshop

- I explain react and react native concepts
- I'll show a demo with the concept
- You'll be given some time to practice / read / understand the code
- Repeat

# What we will be building
- Todo app with authentication and storage with `supabase`
- Image Upload
---

# Tools we will be using

## Expo Router

[Expo router](https://expo.github.io/router/docs) is a library for react-native which makes it easy to make multi-page applications
## Supabase

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is a firebase alternative, which provides features such as authentication, databases, storage and serverless functions. This allows us to build a basic backend with authentication very quickly, and also allows building more complex backends with the serverless functions

---
## Dotenv
[Dotenv](https://github.com/goatandsheep/react-native-dotenv/) allows us to load environment variables from a text file into the app. We will use environment variables to store data, such as `API_URL`. `API_URL` only changes across different builds of the application

## Async Storage

[Async Storage](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/async-storage/) allows us to use local storage on mobile easily. We will be using this to store supabase auth credentials and other details

## Expo Image Picker and Expo Camera
[Image Picker](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/imagepicker/) and [Camera](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/camera/) are two libraries to help out with selecting images

In general, we will try to use the expo provided libraries for compatability and ease of use.

---

# Install dependencies

Install dependencies with the command below
```bash
npx expo install expo-router react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens\
 expo-linking expo-constants expo-status-bar react-native-paper\
 @supabase/supabase-js react-native-url-polyfill @react-native-async-storage/async-storage\
 expo-image-picker

npm install --save-dev react-native-dotenv
```

After making the changes stated in next slide, run to clear the cache and start expo
```bash
npx expo --clear
```
